            <h1>GUIDELINES FOR SUBMISSIONS</h1>
         </div>
         <br>
         <br>
         <h3> GENERAL REQUIREMENTS </h3>
         <p>
            The Lemonade Stand is here to showcase your work to a larger audience. Whether it be art or writing, or even a medium we’ve yet to share, you can publish your work to the world by sending it to bss.literary.journal@gmail.com.
            <br>
            <br>
            For submissions to be accepted they must follow these guidelines:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. Please include the category of the submission in the email’s subject. While multiple works of the same category can be sent one in email, please send works of different categories in different emails.
            <br>
            2. Please provide basic information about each piece you would like published as one work in the following format:
            <br>
            <br>
            Name (real name): Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (example)
            <br>
            Date of completion of work: 26 November 1865
            <br>
            Title: Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
            <br>
            Publish under (pen name): Lewis Carroll
            <br>    
            <br>
            3. Please include any information about the work which you would like to be published (descriptions, captions etc.) clearly in the email as well.
            <br>
            4. Further guidelines should be reviewed for written work and visual art.
            <br>
            <br>
            Guidelines exist for organization and so that we can present your work as a true reflection of what you’ve created. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to send the editing team an email at bss.literary.journal@gmail.com. 
         </p>
         <h3> WRITING SUBMISSION GUIDELINES </h3>
         <h5>General</h5>
         <p>
            All submissions should be sent as Word Documents.
            The font of your submission will change in any case when published, so please send your work in a neutral font such as Roman font or Arial.
         </p>
         <h5>Poetry</h5>
         <p>
            If you have several short poems in one set, give each individual poem either a title or a roman numeral. Fillout the above information once for the entire set.
            We do our best to preserve the formatting of poetry. In some cases, this is not entirely possible. If your poem has complicated formatting that is crucial to the poem, you must send it as an image file. You can, for example, do this by pasting the poem to Microsoft Paint or taking a high-quality screenshot and saving it as a PNG image file.
         </p>
         <h5>Short Stories, Novels, and Essays</h5>
         <p>
            There is no word limit to short stories, novels, or essays. However, if it exceeds about 4,000 words we will reply asking you to divide the work to be published in parts.
         </p>
         <h3>ART SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</h3>
         <p>
            It is strongly encouraged that you include a signature, watermark or copyright of some sort on all your artwork. This can be added to traditional artwork digitally.
            In all categories fan art will not be accepted. Reproductions or works that are heavily referenced are not encouraged, but permissible if the work referenced is cited and used with permission.
         </p>
         <h5>Comic Submissions</h5>
         <p>
            For guidelines, comics fall under the category of art of their most prominent medium.
         </p>
         <h5>Photography Submissions</h5>
         <p>
            File format is preferably JPEG.
            Photos should be no smaller than 640×480 pixels.
            There is no limit to how large the photo should be.
         </p>
         <h5>Digital Submissions</h5>
         <p>
            File format should be PNG or JPEG, the choice is up to the artist.
            Some programs such as Photoshop will prompt with additional options upon saving as the above file types. The choice is up to the artist, although in general JPEG files should not be saved as progressive and PNG files should not be interlaced.
            PNG-8 and PNG-24 are both fine.
            In general, the resolution of files should be 300 Pixels/Inch (PPI)
            Please either send us a copy of the original file (the PSD file or other format) or ensure that you have an accessible copy stored safely. This is especially an issue if you ever intend to print your work.
            Editors will not modify your work without your consent, except, if the need arises, to resize artwork to smaller dimensions.
         </p>
         <h5>Traditional Submissions</h5>
         <p>
            Work on paper should be on blank paper, unless you have specific reasons otherwise. Avoid lines, unrelated print, and other visual distractions.
            <br>
            <br>
            For smaller submissions:
            <br>
            Artwork of appropriate size should be scanned.
            Because scanning alters the colours of the work (though less so than photography) it is strongly encouraged to do corrections via software such as Photoshop, Picasa or iPhoto.
            <br>
            <br>
            For larger submissions:
            <br>
            Larger artwork should be photographed.
            <br>
            For advice on photographing artwork, this is an excellent video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpj28da03JQ . Watching it is recommended, especially if you have little experience with photography, as it’s only 4 minutes.
            <br>
            Consider undergoing final edits (cropping out extra space, fixing colours) via software such as Photoshop, Picasa or iPhoto.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the event you don’t have access to the necessary technology it is perfectly acceptable to make do with what you have on hand. Editors would be more than happy to assist you though, whether that be scanning for you or assisting with software, in which case please send us an email including the category of your artwork and a brief explanation of your difficulty (e.g. Scanning Trouble) in the subject line.
